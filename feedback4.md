#### 1) Project Planning

A project consists of more than just code.

This project requires **planning** organized within a **Trello board** with the following **lists**:

-[x] **Icebox**: Holds user stories that have yet to be moved to the _Current/MVP_ list. All user stories are originally put into the _Icebox_, including both MVP and wish list stories.

-[x] **Current/MVP**: Holds user stories that must be completed to meet the minimum project requirements (MVP). Once the MVP has been met, additional user stories may be moved from the _Icebox_.

-[x] **Completed**: Hold completed user stories.

-[x] **Wireframes**: Sketches of each screens's user interface for the major functionality of the application.

-[x] **Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)**: A diagram of the app's models (one per data entity) and the relationships between them.

> User stories need to be formed properly using this template:<br>`As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>`. The _reason_ is optional if it's patently obvious.

#### 2) Project Source Control & README

The project must include a **`README.md`** file with the following sections:

-[x] **Introduction**: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more screenshots.

-[x] **Technologies Used**: A list of all technologies, libraries, APIs, etc. used in the project.

-[x] **Getting Started**: Links to the project's planning (Trello board) and the **deployed app** on Heroku.

-[x] **Unsolved Problems**: List any unsolved issues.

-[x] **Future Enhancements**: Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project.

#### 3) Application Technical Requirements/Deliverables

-[x] A **working** full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku.

-[x] Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack**: - MongoDB/Mongoose - Express - React - Node

-[x] **Have a well-styled interactive front-end** that communicates with the **Express** backend via AJAX.

-[x] Implement token-based **authentication**. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.

-[x] Implement **authorization** by restricting CUD data functionality to appropriately authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

-[x] **Have a comprehensive feature-set**. For example, **if the app does not include full-CRUD** data operations, **ensure the addition** of one or more of the following: - Consume a third-party API. - Utilize multi-user, real-time communications. - Include _admin_ features.

#### 4) Project Feedback

Phenomenal job all cohort. It was a boon having you on site to provide further context to the materials covered in class. Your presentation was great, and the website is coming along more than nicely. It was refreshing to see the intricacies with respect to your forms in react. I thought the front-end looked amazing all around. Your server-side code looks just as clean. All in all excellent having you in this program!
